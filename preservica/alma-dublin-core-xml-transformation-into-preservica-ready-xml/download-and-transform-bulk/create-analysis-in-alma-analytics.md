**Search for the Collection Name title** and either **double click it** or **click it once** before **clicking the `>`** to populate the "Selected" box with the collection you want to filter for a set. Finally, **click OK twice.**

The Filters panel will show the collection name. Once you confirm the collection name, **click Results** to make sure the PIDs are displaying.

You'll then see a table with PIDs and Collection Names. Now you will **Save As** a new analysis to keep the template empty of filters. Save it as the Collection Name Set, e.g., Irving Bienstock project Set. _This may go into a sub folder of sets?_
